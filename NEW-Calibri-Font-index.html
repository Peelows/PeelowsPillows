	This game tells a story, through the eyes of a few characters, whom at the time, were unaware of the friendships
	and roles they were to fulfill.
	</p>
	<h2>Everyone's role in the story will show through in time.</h2>
	<p>
	The main character's outlook and mindset were shaped through his varied past. His choices and actions from where
 	the story picks up will start to shape who he will become as the story progresses.
